## Summary
* The data shows that there are a significant number of employees that are either retirement or menorshop eligible, most of which being at senior level positions. In total, about 63% of the employees are either retirment or mentorship eligible. 
* This company will have to fill a lot of roles over the coming years but bringing in a younger workforce could be great for them in the longrun. If theyre able to effectively instill the core values of the company into the newer genereaton of workers, they can continue the legacy the older workers have created along with bring in all of the new ideas of the younger workers.
  * This can be accomplished by having eligible employees join the mentorship program and help train the future of this company
